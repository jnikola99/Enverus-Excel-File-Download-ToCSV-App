# Enverus-Excel-File-Download-ToCSV-App
-This application was made as a solution to an interview question for Enverus 

-The whole solution to the problem is written in WebScrape -> Controllers -> HomeController.cs 

-The app is a .NET Web MVC application but for the purpose of this test a regular C#(.NET) console app would have sufficed as well

-Recommended to run with IIS Express

-NuGet packages that need to be downloaded:
  1)HtmlAgilityPack.NetCore
  2)Syncfusion.XlsIO.Net.Core
  3)Syncfusion.EJ2.AspNet.Core
  
 -IMPORTANT: When the program is ran, the downloaded file and new CSV file is located on C:\temp directory
